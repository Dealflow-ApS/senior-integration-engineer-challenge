## Challenge details

- **Accounting API Integration Module**: Develop a module in Python that uses the [e-conomic API](https://www.e-conomic.com/) or [dinero API][https://dinero.dk/] to connect to accounting services. Implement functionalities for creating invoices, posting payments, and retrieving financial reports to reflect transaction processing within an accounting context.

- **Advanced Transaction Processing System**: Build a system that not only processes transactions but also validates them against predefined rules (e.g., duplicate detection, threshold validation). Incorporate a queuing mechanism to efficiently manage transaction volume, ensuring reliability and consistency.


-   **Comprehensive Testing and Documentation**:
    
    -   Create a suite of automated tests covering unit, integration, and load scenarios to validate the functionality and reliability of your system under different conditions.
    -   Provide detailed documentation on setting up the e-conomic API integration, including how to obtain API keys and configure your environment. Your documentation should also cover the implemented features, security practices, error handling strategies, and instructions for running tests.
-   **Additional Notes**:
    -   Highlight any assumptions made during development, especially concerning e-conomic API responses and transaction processing logic.
    -   Include guidelines for securely managing API credentials and sensitive data, emphasizing best practices in application security and data protection.
    - Feel free to exclude certain implementations if you think they are taking too much time. Just explain to us how you would have done it
    - Feel free to use dummy data

## Factors that will be used to evaluate your assignment

-   **API Integration**: Ability to integrate with e-conomic effectively. Assess the use of authentication, data retrieval, and transaction initiation methods.
-   **Backend Development**: Implementation of the architecture, including the choice of AWS services, handling of data, and execution of backend logic.
-   **Performance Optimization**: Identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks, efficient use of resources, and scalability of the solution.
-   **Security Practices**: Application of security measures, including data encryption, secure API interactions, and compliance with standards like PCI DSS or GDPR.
-   **Code Quality**: Cleanliness, organization, and readability of the code. Include considerations for comments, naming conventions.
-   **Testing**: Completeness of the testing suite, including unit, integration, and performance tests, and the thoroughness of test cases covering various scenarios.
-   **Documentation / Code comments Quality**: Clarity, completeness, and utility of the provided documentation, including setup instructions, API usage examples, and system architecture explanations.
-   **CI/CD and Automation**: Implementation of CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment, looking at the use of GitHub Actions and AWS CodeDeploy, as well as any additional automation that improves development workflow.
